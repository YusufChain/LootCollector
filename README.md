# LOOTCOLLECTOR
> This Minecraft plugin creates its own virtual chest even if your server inventory is full, and drops items you're trying to collect from minefields into the /collector chest. 
> It's optimized and I've provided the source code for further development. 
> The plugin supports all versions 1.16.5 and above.
